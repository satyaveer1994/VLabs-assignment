## Library Management System

This project is a web-based library management system that allows users to sign up as either a librarian or a member and perform various actions based on their role. Librarians can add, update, and remove books and members, while members can view, borrow, and return available books.

The project is built using Node.js and MongoDB, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
